    <h5><strong>What types of rewards should I offer?</strong></h5>
    <p>
      You can offer any Drop In reward you wish to encourage users to visit your bar.
      We recommend offering enticing rewards to Drop In users, which may include the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Discounted drink &amp; food coupons</li>
      <li>% or $’s off total bill (i.e., $5 off when you spend $25 or more)</li>
      <li>Free cover for entry or “line cuts”</li>
      <li>Personal happy hour deals</li>
      <li>Other drink &amp; food specials</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Remember, the cost of this reward is the cost of acquiring a new customer that will visit
      your bar over others in the community!
    </p>

    <h5><strong>Is a user's loyalty level specific to each bar?</strong></h5>
    <p>
      No. The Drop In loyalty program is a community-based program, and is not specific to each bar.
      Users earn credits that apply to their Drop In loyalty level.
    </p>
    <p>
      A user's loyalty level will be applicable at every participating bar in the Drop In community.
      Users can redeem rewards they have earned at any participating bar in the Drop In community.

    <h5><strong>How do I know a user is redeeming a valid Drop In reward?</strong></h5>
    <p>
      Simply look for the countdown screen and confirm it is decreasing.
      This ensures the reward is active and valid. A customer will have 120 seconds to
      show you the screen once they hit the redeem button.
