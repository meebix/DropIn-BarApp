    <h5><strong>What types of rewards should I offer?</strong></h5>
    <p>
      You can offer any Drop In Reward you wish to encourage users to visit your bar.
      We recommend offering enticing rewards to Drop In users, which may include the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Discounted drink &amp; food coupons</li>
      <li>% or $’s off total bill (i.e., $5 off when you spend $25 or more)</li>
      <li>Free cover for entry or “line cuts”</li>
      <li>Personal happy hour deals</li>
      <li>Other drink &amp; food specials</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Remember, the cost of this reward represents the cost for encouraging a customer to visit
      your bar over others in the community! Selecting an enticing reward can not only help you
      acquire new customers, but retain loyal customers as well.

    <h5><strong>Is a user's loyalty level specific to each bar?</strong></h5>
    <p>
      No. Credits earned at any participating bar will contribute to your Drop In loyalty level.
      This loyalty level will be applicable at all participating bars in the Drop In community.
      Additionally, when rewards are received, they are eligible for redemption at any bar in
      the Drop In community.

    <h5><strong>How do I know a user is redeeming a valid Drop In Reward?</strong></h5>
    <p>
      Simply look for the reward redemption (or countdown) screen and confirm it is decreasing.
      This ensures the reward is active and valid. A customer will have 120 seconds to show you
      the screen once they hit the redeem button.
